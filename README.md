Temperature Monitoring System
I've created a comprehensive temperature monitoring system demonstration that includes all the deliverables you requested. The system features a realistic simulation of how the actual hardware would work, complete with:
The interactive demonstration shows a virtual LCD display, temperature gauge, and serial monitor that update in real-time. You can use the controls to simulate temperature changes and see how the system responds. The circuit design section provides detailed component specifications and wiring diagrams, while the Arduino code section shows the complete, production-ready code that would run on actual hardware.
